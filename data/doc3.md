Title: RAG explained

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval with a language model.
First, the system retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base using similarity search.
Then, the language model generates an answer grounded in that retrieved context, which helps reduce hallucinations and improves factual accuracy.
