Title: Vector databases and embeddings

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture meaning. Similar texts have similar vectors.
A vector database stores embeddings and supports similarity search. This allows retrieval of the most relevant documents to a question.
LanceDB is a vector database that can store both vectors and the original text so we can retrieve context for a RAG system.
